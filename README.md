# Graph Assistant Project

<h3>-Project description</h3>
<h4>A simple class for working with graphs.</h4>

<b>-Class methods :</b>
<br>
1- `__init__` : Its a constructor method , it import your file data to program.

2- `ShowIT` : This method graphically displays the input graph.

3- `GetMaxV` : This method displays the vertex with the highest degree in the graph

4- `GetIncidence` : This method displays the incidence graph matrix

5- `GetAllv` : Show the degree of all vertices of the graph

6- `Connectivity` : Checks if the graph is connected

7- `HaveCycle` : Checks if the graph have a cycle

8- `CoLorinG` : This method colors all vertices of the graph

9- `Bipartite` : Checks if the graph is two-part or not


<h3>-How to use</h3>
First of all , your need to install python from <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads">This site</a> , then you should open windows powershell in source directory and type :

<code>python -m pip install -r requirments.txt</code>

After that , necessary modules for my project will be installed.

Then you can open my project with python and enjoy.


*** Remember to enter the name of the file that contains the adjacency matrix in the program ***
